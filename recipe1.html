<h1> Egg Bake</h1>
<h2> Recipe Ingredients</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt> Eggs</dt>
    <dd> 6 eggs, beaten.</dd>

    <dt> Cottage Cheese</dt>
    <dd> Most brands work here, but I will specifically be using 8 oz low-fat cottage cheese.</dd>

    <dt> Shredded Cheddar</dt>
    <dd> 6 oz fat-free cheddar cheese. Using a normal kind of cheese will increase calories. </dd>

    <dt> Turkey Sausage</dt>
    <dd> 1/2 pound of cooked sausage, crumbled. You can find a tube of this at Target!</dd>

    <dt> Bell Peppers</dt>
    <dd> Choose 2 peppers of any colors you like, I am using orange and yellow. These will be chopped.</dd>

    <dt> Onion</dt>
    <dd> One medium yellow onion, chopped. </dd>

    <dt> Low Calorie Spray</dt>
    <dd> I am using Pam, but any off brand will work. Spray baking pan before use as well as for sauteing.</dd>

    <dt> Spices</dt>
    <dd> 1 tsp each of salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. </dd>
  </dl>

  <p> Begin by preheating your oven to 400 degrees. </p>
    
  <p> Beat the eggs with cottage cheese in a large bowl.</p>

  <p> Next, saute your peppers and onions in the same pan you cooked your turkey sausage. Spray pan with cooking spray. Cook until onions are translucent and peppers are fragrant.</p>

  <p> Mix in your sausage, shredded cheese, and cooked peppers and onions into your egg mixture. Add spices. </p>

  <p> Spray baking pan with cooking spray. Pour mixture into pan. Cover with foil. </p>

  <p> Let your egg bake cook, covered, for 45 minutes. For the last 15, remove foil. Once the egg bake is no longer jiggly, it is done. Enjoy!</p>
